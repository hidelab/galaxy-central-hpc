**What it does**

This tool takes the computed PathPrint Fingerprint as input and uses it to determine how similar
your data are to a consensus signature generated from a set of pluripotent samples in GEO. 

-----

**Input**: A PathPrint Fingerprint file from your history

**Output**: 

1. Distance from pluripotent consensus: tab delimited file containing distance and p-value for each sample from the pluripotent consensus signature.

2. Histogram: PDF file containing two histograms: (1) distribution of distances for ~180,000 GEO samples from the pluripotent signature; (2) distribution of distances for the input samples from the pluripotent signature.
